Extracting IP addresses from responses.

This is a medium difficulty project. This will serve as the foundation for the upcoming programming projects. A working client code is given to you in Client.py; this is the same client as project 0.  Your job, like project 0, is to write the corresponding server code. The goal of the server is to reply to any client with the IP address of any domain name sent to it. 


The server is not allowed to use gethostbyname or any similar function designed to do DNS. Instead, the server must send a UDP message to the Google DNS server at 8.8.8.8 and ask it for the IP address. This means the server will need two sockets, one server socket to talk to the client and one client socket to talk to the Google DNS server. You must construct this DNS message according to your knowledge of the protocol and the provided resources. Lastly, it should then close gracefully when the client is done sending domain names. Sample output and input files have also been provided. Note that due to certain aspects of the way DNS works, your output may not exactly match the sample; you can check if it worked by typing the IP address into your browser and making sure you get the right webpage.


If the DNS server at 8.8.8.8 sends many answers, send all of them back to the client separated by a ‘,’ character in the order that they were sent to you. If the answer is not an A record, you may simply return the string ‘OTHER’ once per a non-A answer instead of an ip address.

Here is a diagram of the header from the RFC (if these diagrams confuse you read the routly blog post from the resources).

and the question looks like:

                                    1  1  1  1  1  1
      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5

    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
 and the answer:

                                    1  1  1  1  1  1
